 # Features
 - Upload Data: Allows you to upload a CSV file with data from the rural property register in Portugal. A CSV file is provided with data from the autonomous region of Madeira.

 - Graph Representations: The rural property register, where the nodes represent the properties and the edges represent the adjacency relationships between the nodes (between the properties),is represented in a graph. It can be visualised on the User Interface

 - Average Property Area: Calculates the average area of properties, for a geographical/administrative area specified by the user (parish, municipality, district). Also calculates the average area of properties assuming that adjacent properties of the same owner are considered to be just one property, for a geographical/administrative area specified by the user.

 - Graph of the neighbourhood relationship between owners: Represents in a graph the neighbourhood relations between owners where the nodes correspond to the owners and the edges represent the neighbourhood relations between the nodes. A landowner is considered to be a neighbour of another landowner if they have contiguous properties.

 - Property Exchange Suggestions: Generates suggestions for property exchanges between owners that maximise the average area of each owner's property.
